# Notice! 
Pokebattler is no longer running off of this code base. There is significant database integration and user login code that I do not want to try and maintain a no database implementation anymore.  Perhaps in the future if there is enough interest I can opensource a version that uses api endpoints instead of direct database integrations but its a lot of work and to my knowledge, not many people are using this code base. Please feel free to contact me for more details if you are interested.
