We also plan to have analysis tools to evaluate your battle parties for potential weaknesses and provide suggestions for filling out a battle party.",

The rankings do not currently consider dual charge moves or combat stopping during a charge move or shielding. Big specials like Hyper Beam are going to do a bit worse than they appear on this list as they are vulnerable to shielding."
