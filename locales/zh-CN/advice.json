  "intro": "Pokebattler Advice is a custom feature designed to help you optimize your Pokebox for specific raids. Simply select the raid boss you wish to find the best potential Pokemon to fight against it with, and enter the stardust and candy you have available to see how your Pokemon will look after they are powered up. This tool will help you decide which Pokemon will gain the most from that stardust and candy so you know how to spend it with maximum efficiency.",
  "intro2": "After you have run a simulation, click on any Pokemon to see how much improvement you get after each Power Up. There are often breakpoints where you can stop powering your Pokemon up after you hit them to save yourself some stardust and candy! This is different than other breakpoint tools you have seen as it empirically finds breakpoints, even ones that are not obvious."
